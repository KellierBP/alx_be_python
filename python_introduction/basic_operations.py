# Step 1: Define the numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Step 2: Perform operations
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference_result = number1 - number2
product_result = number1 * number2

# Step 3: Print results
print(f"The sum of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"The difference of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")
print(f"The product of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")
